Update 09 Jan, 2011

** Added the cudaComplex<T> class: 
         Can be run by devices of CUDA compute 2.0 or higher.  Using this, 
         I can use complex numbers as native, algebraic objects, and will 
         be able to implement any kind of IFS fractal, now.  Using the new
         cudaComplex<T> class increases computation time by about 5-10%
         (though, still about 20,000x faster than MATLAB with complex numbers)
         
         Manual complex-multiplication in kernel (4096x4096 tile, 1024 max esc):
         ---Single-precision w/ mem copy:  0.195 s
         ---Double-precision w/ mem copy:  0.562 s

         Using cudaComplex<T> (4096x4096 tile, 1024 max esc):
         ---Single-precision w/ mem copy:  0.202 s
         ---Double-precision w/ mem copy:  0.624 s


** Complex<T> class:
         This was a regular C++ implementation of the cudaComplex<T> before
         I realized that it needed to be converted to __device__ code.  I left
         this class in the project even though it's completely redundant w.r.t.
         to std::complex<T>

** Quaternion Class:
         I implemented this in the most tedious way possible, to later realize
         it's probably completely unnecessary.  It hasn't been compiled or
         tested in any way, I just wanted to get the non-commutative algebra in
         there.  I should be able to use them for higher-dimensional fractals,
         later.

This CUDA code is a very basic Mandlebrot generator using CUDA (NVIDIA gfx card)
The code is kind of sloppy, and simplistic (though Mandlebrots aren't difficult
to code, at all), but it works if you have CUDA installed and a newer NVIDIA
graphics card.  Eventually, as I learn more about fractals, I will expand this
library to generate more types of fractals.

To learn more about CUDA, or to download more of the files you need to compile
this code, you can check out my other CUDA project on github, 
      CUDA-Image-Processing


If you are familiar with CUDA, you will realize that fractals are an absolutely
*PERFECT" application for CUDA.  You don't have to pass in an image, only a few
parameters that define the fractal, and the calculations are relatively simple,
and completely parallelizable.  You should see the full advantage of your GPU 
with this program.

For reference, I put this same code together, though much more simply, in MATLAB
and it took 632s to run (it probably wasn't efficient at all, but it did work).
By comparison, I've put about the same amount of sloppy effort into this CUDA
code, and it runs in 0.026s.  

Yes, that's a 24,000x speedup.  That is higher than the theoretical limit for a
CUDA card that only has 10,000 threads, but there's also a lot of overhead with
the simplistic MATLAB code.  A mandlebrot generator that came with the CUDA SDK
shows about 1000x speedup over C++, which is a bit more reasonable.  Typically,
for image processing in general, you would expect to see somewhere between 20x
and 200x.
